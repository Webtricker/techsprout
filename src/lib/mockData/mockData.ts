With tools like Unity and Unreal Engine offering free or affordable licenses, barriers to entry have never been lower. Indie devs thrive on creativity, often experimenting with unique mechanics, art styles, and storytelling approaches that large studios avoid due to financial risks. Digital platforms like Steam and itch.io give indie games direct access to players worldwide. Crowdfunding and early access models also provide funding opportunities that were unimaginable a decade ago. This democratization of game creation has led to masterpieces like Hollow Knight, Celeste, and Stardew Valley. The key to indie success isn’t massive budgets but passion, innovation, and community engagement.`,
